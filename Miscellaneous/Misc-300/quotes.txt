We're going to get you. We're going to get you. Not another peep. Time to go to sleep.
I believe I have made a significant find in the Kandarian ruins, a volume of ancient Sumarian burial practices and funerary incantations. It is entitled "Naturum De Montum", roughly translated: Book of the Dead. The book is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. It deals with demons and demon resurrection and those forces which roam the forest and dark bowers of Man's domain. The first few pages warn that these enduring creatures may lie dormant but are never truly dead.
Shut up, Linda!
Groovy.
I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your soul! Swallow this.
After all, I'm a man and you're a woman... at least last time I checked. Huh huh.
Gimme back my hand... GIMME BACK MY HAND!
Sure, I could have stayed in the past. I could have even been king. But in my own way, I *am* king.
Hail to the king, baby.
Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.
Gimme some sugar, baby.
Well hello Mister Fancypants. Well, I've got news for you pal, you ain't leadin' but two things, right now: Jack and shit... and Jack left town.

Oh that's just what we call pillow talk, baby, that's all.
Look, maybe I didn't say every single little tiny syllable, no. But basically I said them, yeah.
I may be bad... but I feel gooood.
Hey! What's that you got on your face?
Don't touch that please, your primitive intellect wouldn't understand alloys and compositions and things with... molecular structures.
Buckle up Bonehead. 'Cause you're goin' for a ride!
London bridge is falling down, falling down, falling doown!
Whoa. Wrong book.
