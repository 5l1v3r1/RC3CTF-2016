Okay, to be honest, I was gonna make this like 10x harder, but I figured I shouldn't expect people to know how to use Audacity THAT well. So I'm giving them the audacity file since isolating the beeeeeps is only half the battle. They still gotta figure out it's SSTV with a ScottieDX protocol. Should be interesting.

Anyway
to do:

Delete all the tracks other than the beeeeep one. 

Get a SSTV decoder

Figure out its ScottieDX, either you know beforehand or you guess until your ears bleed.

Play music, let the decoder record.

4 excrutiating minutes later, you have a flag!!!
